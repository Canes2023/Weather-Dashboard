# Weather-Dashboard

For this assignment, I was tasked to create a weather dashboard that shows you the weather for a city that you type in the search box. All you have to do is type any city you want in the search box and you will get the name of the city with the date next to it, the temperature, humidity, and wind speed as well as the weather telling you if it's cloudy, partly cloudy, day time, night time, raining, or snowing. I also added a search history where you can see all the latest searches that the user has made and when you click on one, it automatically makes the search for you so you don't have to type the name again. You can also see the search history in local storage. This weather data is powered by OpenWeather API. 

Code source came from me. The code is located in the main branch of the repo. The css code is located in the css folder and script code is located in the js folder.
